description: My personal opinion on why Steam is the best game launcher and store for PC gaming in the market.

If you've ever bought a PC game before, it was almost 100% off of Steam. With over 120,000,000 users a month, it's the biggest distributor for games, and for good reason. There's no bullshit that you need to get through to launch a game. Simply launch Steam, select the game, and **Play**. Three clicks (or maybe four if you have to select a launch option).

I myself have used Steam for the better part of four years ever since I switched over from [this old pile of a barely working console](/blog/forza-horizon-3/xbox-one-s.png), to a computer that decently works enough to play most of the games I play daily.

The whole reason I'm writing this is because of one of Steam's latest features, [Steam Families](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4149575031735702628), which piqued my interest. It's great to see companies like Valve doing stuff like this:

<div align="center">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <em>Hello! We are excited to announce the launch of Steam Families, now accessible in the Steam Beta Client. This feature introduces significant updates and improvements to family sharing, parental controls, and child purchase requests.</em>
    </p>
    &mdash; Steam <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1769797470673076564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">(@Steam)</a>
  </blockquote>
</div>

...and it got me thinking how Steam beats out every other launcher there is, which is what I'll talk about.

# Sales

Easily one of the best things about Steam is the amount of sales they put out every single year. While they have the four major sales (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), they also have smaller sales, almost all of the time. Rarely do I actually pay full price for a game, except for certain exceptions, like this:

<div align="center">
<video src="/blog/steam/buying-fh5.mp4" controls></video>
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">This is the kind of stuff I was making three years ago...</div>
</div>

Anyway, I've found some amazing games just from these Steam sales, particularly the seasonal ones, one of my favourites and most memorable being [OneShot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/).

Not to mention, as a nice little touch, the store page gets redesigned for these sales, which adds some nice art to the store page.

# Community

The Steam Community is where a lot of things, including but not limited to the [Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/), [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/), and other things like Reviews, Guides, Artwork, and more.

Particularly for Counter-Strike, the market has single-handedly kept the CS scene alive by giving it a real-world economy with real-world money and value. The workshop has let games continue off of their communities by letting them make custom mods/maps/anything you can think of to expand the game, and the others provide a personality to Steam, unlike other launchers, my next point.

# Other Launchers

Obviously, there's more launchers than just Steam, but they're very lackluster and mediocre at best.

Let's take an example like the Epic Games Launcher. When it comes to mind, all I use it for is to launch Fortnite. It took them [**THREE YEARS**](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-games-store-shopping-cart) to add a **shopping cart**. Not to mention, the launcher itself is really lackluster, that's including all of the games on it. The only redeeming factor of it is that there is a free game every week, although most aren't very good in my opinion.

Other launchers like EA sometimes just...don't want to work? At least in my experience, whenever I play an EA game, sometimes the EA App, which launches the game I'm trying to play, will just...uninstall itself. I have to manually reinstall it and repair it through the installer.

I also don't like the fact that a lot of games on Steam, particularly from publishers like EA or Ubisoft, love to embed their own launcher into the game, so that when I click 'Play', it actually opens the other games' launcher, and launches the game there. What is the point of me launching a game just for it to take over a minute to launch because it's using ANOTHER launcher?

To prove my point, here is a comparison between two games. The first video is me launching [Rainbow Six Siege](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359550/Tom_Clancys_Rainbow_Six_Siege/) (a Ubisoft game) through Steam, while the second is a video of me launching [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) (a game that does not need another launcher packaged with it) through Steam:

### Rainbow Six Siege:

<div align="center">
<!-- Rainbow Six Siege !-->
<video src="/blog/steam/siege-launch-time.mp4" controls></video>

<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">Time Taken: 2:03:90</div>
</div>

### Geometry Dash:

<div align="center">
<!-- Geometry Dash !-->
<video src="/blog/steam/geometry-dash-launch-time.mp4" controls></video>

<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">Time Taken: 00:03:33</div>
</div>

# UI

The UI, while deep, is simple. There's four sections, Store, Library, Community, and one with your username. Like I mentioned earlier, it takes me three clicks to open a game:

* Open Steam
* Click on game I want to play
* Click 'Play'

Simple as that, no lag, nothing, unlike Rockstar, which for some reason, eats my PC's resources up. The UI did recently [get a redesign](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3686801719529689368), which also made it look nicer.

<div align="center">
<img src="/blog/steam/old-ui.png">
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">Old</div>
</div>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="/blog/steam/new-ui.png">
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">New</div>
</div>

Although, some parts of the UI have taken quite a while to update. An example of this is the Server Browser, commonly used in games with community maps, such as [CS2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/) and [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/), which was only updated 11 months ago, prior to which had been many years without change:

<div align="center">

<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">Old</div>
</div>

<div align="center">
<img src="/blog/steam/new-server-browser-ui.png">
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(161 161 170);">New</div>
</div>

# Valve

The company behind Steam. They've made some of the most iconic games, such as [Half-Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/), [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/) and [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/), [Counter-Strike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/), and more. They formed Steam in 2003 to serve as a distribution channel for games. They also created hardware like the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) and [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex).

# TL;DR

Steam is good and has a lot of features which extends it, whereas other launchers are either barebones, lack anything notable, or are downright bad, or all three if they stoop that low.
