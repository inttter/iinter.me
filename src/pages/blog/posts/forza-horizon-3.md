# Introduction

It was Christmas of 2016. I woke up early in the morning to
open my presents, to recieve the very thing that would change my life:

This was my introduction into gaming. I got a few games along with it too, such as:

* Rocket League
* Minecraft (the *OLD* one.)
* FIFA 17 (although I was never really into football)

And of course, **Forza**, specifically, [Horizon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3) 
(which is sadly delisted now).

# The First Experience

Thinking back now, Forza Horizon 3 was the ***best*** Forza game that there ever was. Why?
Because everything about the game was perfect. The community, the new features, the **cars** themselves, I could go on. 

I remember the first game I installed on that Xbox above was Forza. I also remember booting it up for the first time to hear that **AMAZING** title screen music. For those curious, you can see it below:

# Progressing Through

To be honest? Most of my time on this game was spent Freeroaming around the map, getting every little collectable, driving over every little road that was still marked gray.

> "How about your experience online?"

Thanks to me not having [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/gold) for a grand total of about 2 years, I didn't play online *a single time*. Well, at least until I came back *way, way later*, but my point is I spent all of my time on this game playing singleplayer.

Aside from only freeroaming, I also dabbled in roleplaying, in the form of roleplaying doing different things inside of FH3. Yes, I know. It sounds odd and weird, but under-13 me was a different person back then, compared to now.

<span style="color: #d8e;">Fun Fact: I **only** started doing this because of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDQ7KLGe42s) I saw back in ~2017.</span>

And I also progressed through the game as any normal person did, buying new cars, upgrading them, driving them, completing [#FORZATHON](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3/Forzathon)'s, and taking photo's of my cars, which I'd love to show you some of, but they [removed the functionality to save them](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1551360/discussions/0/3416557114763087581/). Instead, here's some photo's from the newer games, which should do justice *enough*:

# Community

The community within this game was **awesome**. There were tons of YouTube videos and YouTuber's I discovered just from playing this game. 

If I wasn't playing the game, I was probably on my (albeit very bad) iPhone 5 watching somebody like [AR12Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AR12Gaming) talk about the newest car added to the game or playing a minigame, or watching a **"Funny Moments"**  compilation from somebody like [Shinyodd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE37PeTZtEg&t=37s) or [YEAHMAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AoTnOHIJE) That, to me, is probably the part I miss the most.

# Now

I've aged 8 years since I first touched this game, and even *still*, I sometimes wipe the dust off of my Xbox (that, at this point, I don't know how long it's been since I've touched it), put the **Forza Horizon 3** disc inside of the console, and boot up the game just to drive around for a little bit.

Not to mention, I have no problems playing online anymore, so I've tried going online here and there, and have had some amazing experiences cruising with others and playing minigames like *Infection* or *King*. You can ***still*** find full lobbies on this game after only a few seconds!

When I first wanted to go back to this game, I wanted to do it on PC, because I have *all* of my games there, and FH3 has [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), meaning that if you played it on your Xbox, you could go on the same account on PC and be able to play the game there too.

Well, I tried to do this, but unfortunately, even though I was on the right account, I was greeted by this:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892836872118763543/1216075276203855903/image.png?ex=65ff115b&is=65ec9c5b&hm=0f46565098038e0702d456c269e5b2e2dd2dbc6e723702f1b50052f77f41f8da&" width="450">
</div>

Not a single button to download, or even buy ([because they delisted it in 2020](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-Forza-Horizon-3-Unavailable-for-Purchase#:~:text=Forza%20Horizon%203%20and%20its,game%20and%20its%20associated%20content.)) the game. I went through different rabbit holes to try and get access to the game on my machine, but ultimately, I wasn't willing to dig deeper and get myself into something nasty.

I ended up just sucking it up and opened my Xbox for the first time in months, to redownload the game ([46GB!](https://www.google.com/search?q=fh3+install+size+xbox&source=lmns&bih=752&biw=772&client=opera-gx&hs=lfP&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvou2u2-eEAxXPbKQEHUb1CkcQ0pQJKAB6BAgBEAI)), and this is why I hate the delisting of games.

Even as of writing this, I went back to the game about a week or so ago, and it still feels exactly as I remembered.

# Conclusion

This game gave (and still gives) me **SO** much nostalgia, and I'm really happy under-13 me got to have this experience. If you ever get a chance to play it, do it.

While the game may have been delisted, its had a **massive** impact on me. It sparked an interest in me for racing games and cars that continues to this day.

> "What about the newer games?"

You should try [4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/), probably not [5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/). I'd love to play Horizon 5 more, but...

I mean seriously? 170 GB just for a Forza installment, which isn't even that good? That's a fifth of my PC. When the game came out, it was only like ~80 GB, which was about the same as Horizon 4. Not to mention, the game just gets recycled content as *"new"* content.

```
TL;DR: 100% play Horizon 3, try Horizon 4, don't play Horizon 5.
