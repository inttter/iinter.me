description: Thoughts on ways of monetizing in games, and how they are good and bad.

I've been playing video games for basically my entire life. In this time, there's been a large amount of games that I've played, refunded because they were ~~shit~~ bad, or simply got burnt out after playing it for a long time. I've also spent way, way too much money then I should be on games in general.

This, ultimately, leads to spending a lot of money on microtransactions. I talk about a few types here, and a bit of my opinion on it.

### Battle Passes

A common trend is that, most commonly after the release of [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/), many games shifted to this ideology that they need to turn their game into a *"live service"*.

In case you don't know, a live service game is (explained from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bdpmfj/comment/el033rw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Reddit post) as:

> *"A game designed with the sole purpose of keeping people playing for as long as possible in the hopes that those players will pay for microtransactions."*

These battle passes are designed to have FOMO (Feeling Of Missing Out), and it encourages people to grind the game in question to not miss out on exclusive rewards they won't be able to get after the period is over. An example of this is Fortnite, which was one of the first games to use the battle pass system, with other games to follow. There have been 29 seasons of Fortnite, with every single one since Season 2 having a battle pass.

<img src="/blog/monetization-in-games/c1s2-tier75.png" alt="The last tier of the C1S2 Battle Pass, the Black Knight skin. This skin has not returned to the game in the 7 years since it became unobtainable after the season ended.">

This also spawns an ecosystem of buying accounts, hacking, and general breaking of rules the game has set in place. Most commonly, people buy and hack accounts to play with these unobtainable items.

### Lootboxes and Gacha Systems

This is another common form of in-game microtransactions, although not as rampant and bad as battle passes. In fact, some games like Rocket League have [already phased them out](https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/crates-leaving-rocket-league-later-this-year). The point is, some games are **built** on this system. Take an example like [CS2](https://www.counter-strike.net/). CS2 has cases, capsules, stickers, music kits, you get the gist, they have many monetary sources. According to [Insider Gaming](https://insider-gaming.com/valve-cs-cases-earnings/), Valve made over $1,000,000,000 from cases, keys, and the skin market in general. Although, in the case of CS2, the players can also make money since CS2 has an [actual market and value for skins](https://csfloat.com/db).

</div>

Although, this, too, creates a risk of getting scammed and losing thousands and thousands of $$$, and also creates situations like the [CSGOEmpire vs CSGORoll](https://blog.csgoempire.com/the-wars-we-wage/) gambling sites fighting against each other (although, they are both bad, as evidenced by [this braindead *"protest"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcU3hUNOgmo&t=11s) at the PGL Copenhagen Major 2024), which spirals into legal and ethical issues as well.

Now onto the *"gacha system"*. A gacha game is (from Wikipedia):

> *"...a video game that implements the gacha (toy vending machine) mechanic."*

Examples of gacha games which have a *"gacha system"* include [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/), [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/home), and more. The most common tactics these games include are:

* **Randomized Rewards:** Having a chance to get items through randomized draws.
* **Limited-Time Offers:** Events with exclusive or limited-time items, causing people to spend before the opportunity expires (another example of FOMO).
* **Pity Systems:** Reduces the anger of not obtaining anything good. It guarantees a rare reward after a certain number of unsuccessful spins/draws/rolls.

This causes some people to spend absurd amounts of money chasing for these rare rewards, which makes the company many millions or even **billions** in revenue. This also creates a sense of addiction/gambling resemblance, although both Lootboxes and Gacha Systems have these factors.

However, some positives include the fact that communities (or a community) can form for creating rosters, discussions, tips, etc. These systems also help to build content updates, preventing the game from running dry, and they also notably cause the community to create artwork of these characters, most evident with [Genshin](https://genshin.global/art-gallery/official-artwork/).

### Virtual Currency

Again, one of the most common types of microtransactions within games. People spend real-world money to buy currency and then purchase things within the game. This is also typically incoorporated alongside Battle Passes ([mentioned earlier](#using-battle-passes-for-monetization)). 

An example of this is [Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege), which has two different in-game currencies. One is Renown, which is earned from playing matches in Multiplayer, whilst the other is R6 Credits, which is a purchasable currency from the store. The free currency is used to buy essential things within Siege, like new operators, whilst the purchasable currency is optional, but provides much more to purchase. 

In the instance of a free game like Fortnite, this is a case of [Freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium), which is described as:

> *"...a pricing strategy by which a basic product or service is provided free of charge, but money (a premium) is charged for additional features, services, or virtual (online) or physical (offline) goods that expand the functionality of the free version of the software."*

Something to also note is that you tend to get much more of the premium currency (if you buy it) rather than the free currency. This is to encourage people to buy the premium currency, as they'll receive more of it, meaning they spend more of it, then need to refill, so they buy it again, and this cycle repeats itself. 

<img src="/blog/monetization-in-games/apex-coins.png" alt="This is the store page for buying Apex Coins in Apex Legends. In this example specifically, they will try and incentivize people by saying that they will get (X) amount of currency bonus.">

### DLC

DLC's (**D**own**l**oadable **C**ontent) offer additional content to people who may have completed the game already (**most of the time**, without competitive advantages), or expand the game further out. This is a main method of how publishers get people to keep coming back to their game. 

An example of an actually good, well-thought out, and content expansion DLC which had work put into it is the [Dying Light: The Following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_Light:_The_Following) DLC, which was an expansion and continuation of the main storyline from the main [Dying Light 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/) campaign. This DLC featured a new map, new characters, a new story, and a 9 hour length (if you're just trying to finish the story).

  <img src="/blog/monetization-in-games/dl1-dlc-2.png" width="350">
 </div>

Some games also like to bundle some or all of their DLC's into one edition of the game, and a few even make them the main edition of the game. This is shown with Dying Light 1, which has 2 editions, one with some of the DLC, and one with every DLC in the game.

<img src="/blog/monetization-in-games/dl1-bundles.png" alt="The 'Enhanced Edition' contains some more bigger and essential DLC's, while the 'Definitive Edition' has every DLC in the game, minus the free ones, which you need to get yourself.">

### Misc 

I'm not going to give my thoughts of *every single* microtransaction method, but here are some more examples, in bullet point form:

* **In-Game Advertising** - Ads within games. An example of this is [Roblox's sponsored ads](https://brands.roblox.com/solutions/advertising).
* **Subscriptions** - Paying a certain period for access to things/games. Example of this are things like [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass) and [PlayStation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-plus/).
* **Sponsorships** - Self explanatory. Paying/being paid to promote something.
* **Pay to Play** - Games that have an upfront cost and **no microtransactions**.
* **Donations** - Something which is free with no microtranscations, which makes money through other people donating money to the people in question.

Ultimately, every (popular) game is going to get microtransactions someday. With the increase in companies shoving microtransactions in everyone's faces, it's almost inevitable.
