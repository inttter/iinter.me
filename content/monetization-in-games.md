description: Thoughts on ways of monetizing in games, and how they are good and bad.
---

I've been playing video games for basically my entire life. In this time, there's been a large amount of games that I **played**, **refunded** because they were ~~shit~~ **bad**, or simply got **burnt out** after playing it for a long time. I've also spent way too much money then I should be on games in general.

This, ultimately, leads to spending a lot of money on microtransactions. I talk about a few types here, and a bit of my opinion on it.

### Battle Passes

A common trend commonly amongst some games is that after the release of [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/), many of them shifted to an ideology that they had to become a **live service**.

In case you don't know, a live service game is (explained from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bdpmfj/comment/el033rw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Reddit post) as:

> *"A game designed with the sole purpose of keeping people playing for as long as possible in the hopes that those players will pay for microtransactions."*

These battle passes are designed to have FOMO (Feeling Of Missing Out), and it encourages people to grind the game in question to not miss out on exclusive rewards they won't be able to get after the period is over. An example of this is Fortnite, which was one of the first games to use the battle pass system, with other games to follow. There's been 29 seasons of Fortnite, with every single one since Season 2 having a battle pass.

<img src="/images/monetization-in-games/c1s2-tier75.png" alt="The last tier of the C1S2 Battle Pass, the Black Knight skin. This skin has not returned to the game in the 7 years since it became unobtainable after the season ended.">

This also creates a market for buying accounts, hacking, and the general breaking of rules the game has set in place. Most commonly, people buy and hack accounts to play with unobtainable items, which, most of the time goes against the companies' TOS.

### Lootboxes and Gacha Systems

This is another common form of in-game microtransactions, although not as bad as battle passes. In fact, some games like Rocket League have [already phased them out](https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/crates-leaving-rocket-league-later-this-year). Besides that, the point is that some games are **built** on this system. Take an example like [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/), or CS2 for short. CS2 has cases, capsules, stickers, music kits, and more that I won't go into explicitly. They have a lot of monetary sources. According to [Insider Gaming](https://insider-gaming.com/valve-cs-cases-earnings/), Valve made over **$1,000,000,000** from cases, keys, and the skin market in general. Although, CS2 is a slightly different case, as players can also make money since CS2 has an [actual market and value for skins](https://csfloat.com/db).

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/monetization-in-games/csfloat-payout.png" width="350" alt="Here's an example of a withdrawal from the CSFloat Marketplace, which withdrew my funds to my Stripe account, to which I them withdrew from Stripe and into my main bank.">
</div>

Although, this also creates a risk of getting scammed and losing thousands and thousands of your own money, and also creates situations like the [CSGOEmpire vs CSGORoll](https://blog.csgoempire.com/the-wars-we-wage/) gambling sites fighting against each other (although, they are both bad, as evidenced by [this "protest"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcU3hUNOgmo&t=11s) at the PGL Copenhagen Major 2024). This can spiral into real life legal and ethical issues as well.

Now onto the **"gacha system"**. According to Wikipedia, a gacha game is,

> *"...a video game that implements the gacha (toy vending machine) mechanic."*

Examples of gacha games which have a *"gacha system"* include [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/), [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/home), and more. The most common tactics these games include are as follows.

* **Randomized Rewards** — A chance to get different things by rolling for them.
* **Limited-Time Offers** — Events with exclusive/limited-time items ([FOMO](#battle-passes)).
* **Pity Systems** — Guarantees something good after a certain amount of rolls.

This makes people spend large amounts of money chasing for rare cosmetics, which makes the company millions or sometimes **billions** in revenue. This could lead to addiction if it gets bad enough.

Not everything is bad, though. Positives include the fact that communities can form for these types of games. Community interaction motivates devs to build updates, which prevents the game from running dry.

### Virtual Currency

People spend real-world money to buy in-game currency and then buy things within a game. [Battle Passes](#battle-passes) also typically use an in-game currency in order to buy it.

[Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege) has **two** different in-game currencies. One is **Renown**, which is earned from playing matches in Multiplayer, and the other is **R6 Credits**, which is a purchasable currency from the in-game store. Free currency is used to buy things like new operators (characters), whilst the latter is optional, but provides more cosmetic value.

Any free games which have these kinds of monetization are dubbed '**Freemium**', meaning:

> *"A basic product or service is provided free of charge, but money (a premium) is charged for additional features, services, or virtual (online) or physical (offline) goods that expand the functionality of the free version of the software."*

A lot of the time, you tend to get much more of the premium currency that you have to spend money for rather than the free currency (that is, if you buy the premium currency). This is done in order to encourage people to buy the premium currency, as they'll receive more of it, meaning they'll spend more of it, and then need to refill, so they buy it again, and this cycle repeats itself.

<img src="/images/monetization-in-games/apex-coins.png" alt="This is the store page for buying Apex Coins in Apex Legends. In this example specifically, they will try and incentivize people by saying that they will get (𝑥) amount of currency bonus.">

If you want to visualize this, here's a diagram.

### DLC

DLC's (**D**own**l**oadable **C**ontent) offer extra content to people who have completed the game already (most of the time, without competitive advantages), or DLC's may expand the game further out in different factors, like its story. This is a way publishers get people to keep coming back to their game. 

An example of a good, well-thought out, and well-liked content expansion DLC is the [Dying Light: The Following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_Light:_The_Following) DLC, which was an expansion and continuation of the main storyline from the main [Dying Light](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/) campaign. 

In particular, the DLC featured a...

* New **map**
* New **characters**
* New **story** (9+ hours in length)

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 10px;">

  <img src="/images/monetization-in-games/dl1-dlc-2.png" width="350">
 </div>

Sometimes, devs bundle some/all of their game's DLC into one edition of the game, and a few games even make them the main edition of the game, more commonly if the game has been out for a long time. Dying Light has this. It has 2 editions, one with some of the DLC, and one with every DLC in the game.

<img src="/images/monetization-in-games/dl1-bundles.png" alt="The 'Enhanced Edition' contains some more bigger and essential DLC's, while the 'Definitive Edition' has every DLC in the game, minus the free ones, which you need to get yourself.">

### Misc 

Here are some more examples, in bullet point form.

* **In-Game Advertising** - Ads within games.
* **Subscriptions** - Paying a certain period for access to things/games.
* **Sponsorships** - Paying/being paid to promote something.
* **Donations** - Makes revenue from people giving money to the developer.
