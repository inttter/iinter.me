In the Christmas of 2016, I got an Xbox as a present. It was the first time I was able to properly play games after being stuck on a PS3 for a long time. It was the console I was stuck on for quite a few years, even after the last-gen consoles that came out in 2014. 

I got a few games along with my Xbox as well. For example, some prominent ones I got were **Rocket League** and **Minecraft**. As a part of these games, I also got [Forza Horizon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3), the third game from the Forza Horizon franchise which released back in 2016.

In this post, I'll go into more detail about my experiences with the game, aspects of the game, and my opinions on other parts of the franchise in general.

## First Time Playing

When I first played, it was generally argued that Forza Horizon 3 was the one of, if not, the best Horizon game out of the franchise at that point. Everything about the game was at its highest point at the time, from the community and developer interaction, the **content** being added to the game, the online modes, and more.

The initial hours of the game had you playing through the tutorial and going through the story. The story had you doing things customizing your first cars, completing races/events, and other similar activities to unlock and upgrade new festival sites, such as Surfer's Paradise and the Outback. 

The prologue and the first few hours served as a great hook for me to learn the game, especially considering back then I really sucked at racing games ([and maybe I still do](https://twitter.com/accmpy/status/1760440009209917676)).

In fact, I got curious a few months back, and searched for the first game which I installed by checking my first achievements. Coincidentally, one of them was Forza Horizon 3. 

I also remember opening the game up for the first time to hear the title screen music. For those curious, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbJUm_AfJs). I'm still very fond of it, as all of the memories I made with the game come back to me the instant I hear it.

## Progressing Through

I spent most time on this game [free-roaming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_roam) around the map, trying to get every collectable ([there's a lot](https://www.ign.com/maps/forza-horizon-3/australia)), driving over every road that was still marked gray, (meaning they were not found and [there was also 488 of them](https://www.trueachievements.com/a223064/i-know-these-roads-achievement)) and more.

Thanks to me not having [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/gold) for a total of 2 years, I didn't have the chance play online for the duration of the game's maintainability by the developers, which lasted until 2020. I did come back a few years later, after which I got the chance to play multiplayer, but I mostly spent my time on this game playing single player.

I also progressed through the game normally, by buying new cars with the Credits I accumulated, carefully upgrading and tuning them, driving them around the map, free-roaming with them, completing [FORZATHON](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3/Forzathon) events, and taking photos of these cars which I built myself. 

I'd love to show the screenshots that I took back then here, but they [removed the functionality to save them](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1551360/discussions/0/3416557114763087581/) along with the game's de-listing. Instead, here's some photos that I took from Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5:

## Community

In simple terms, the Forza Horizon community **at this time**, in my opinion, reached its highest point for me, and felt the most alive.

When I wasn't playing the game, most of the time I was scouring various things on the internet about the game, such as videos about the latest update with what cars were added, ['funny' montages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE37PeTZtEg&t=38s) (yes, these were a thing), and generally just any video about the game in general.

Inside of the game, people were making loads of liveries, online game-modes were active (and the maps were perfect, making them **SUPER** fun to play on), and the two expansions that they released got the community excited and even more alive.

If I'm being honest, it was really fun back then to just be part of this community. Knowing that there were other people who shared the same interest in this game as me fostered a sense of **belonging**. Even when I took breaks from the game (due to burnout), I **still** kept up with the community side of it.

## The Present

It's been over 8 years since I first played this game, and sometimes, I take out my Xbox, put the disc inside of it, and launch the game to drive around for a bit.

A positive of the present is that I no longer have problems playing online anymore, so I've also went online in most of my latest sessions, and played minigames like [Infection and King](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005307274-FH3-Playground-Games), along with free-roaming and, most of the time, racing. You can **still** find full lobbies on this game, even after the game has been discontinued.

When I first tried to go back to this game, I wanted to do it on PC, because I own all of my games there, and Forza Horizon 3 had [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), so you would be able to keep your progress, provided that you used the same account and owned a digital copy.

I did try to do this, but unfortunately, since the game was de-listed and I had a physical copy of the game on a disk, I could not re-download the game.

![Clicking 'Choose Edition' would tell me every version was unavailable.](/images/fh3-retrospective/fh3-delisted.png)

I could not download or buy the game because it was [de-listed in 2020](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-Forza-Horizon-3-Unavailable-for-Purchase#:~:text=Forza%20Horizon%203%20and%20its,game%20and%20its%20associated%20content.). I tried searching for methods to access the game without having to restart from the beginning, but I stopped because I wasn't willing to dig into the rabbit hole of pirating, which also didn't allow my progress to transfer without repercussions to my own account.

I ended up just dropping the search and opened my Xbox for the first time in a very long time to re-download the game. Luckily, this game is still fully playable as long as the servers stay running, meaning there is still countless hours of gameplay.

## The Other Games

> [!NOTE]
> This section does not mention FH1 or FH2 as there is no PC version available for either.

The Forza Horizon franchise has 5 games in total, 4 of which being de-listed.

Although Forza Horizon 5 is the only purchasable title out of the five in the franchise, I would suggest finding a game key for [Forza Horizon 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/), since while it has been de-listed, keys are still relatively well-priced. It's also a game that still has many players playing it, even more so than the newest title in the franchise, and has hours worth of content.

In my personal opinion, I would not recommend buying [Forza Horizon 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/), as while it is good at times, the bad outweighs it. I explain in more detail in a [Steam review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/inttter/recommended/1551360/) I made which details my problems with the game. Nevertheless, this is just my view, so you could still try the game and enjoy it more than me.

## Conclusion

This game brought back a lot of nostalgia, and I class it as one of my top 5 games that I've ever played because of the enjoyment I got out of playing it.

While the game is now de-listed (and has been for 4 years), it sparked an interest in me for racing and cars in general that I still have to this day, and I'm grateful for that.

**TL;DR: I'm telling you that you should buy (if you can) and play this game.**
