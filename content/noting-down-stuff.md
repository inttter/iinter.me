Lots of the time, but moreso when I go to bed, I remember, or think about something that I want to do the next day. Obviously, since I'll forget it by the end of the morning, I need to note it down somewhere, but how exactly?

There's a whole lot of options out there for how to write stuff down, some even built specifically for that purpose, like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which uses Markdown files.

However, I do it in an (albeit odd) way, that I don't really see most other people doing. I note down stuff by writing it down to myself. On [**Discord**](https://discord.com). At first, this might not make much sense, until you realise that you can make a server that is just *you* in it, and since nobody else can see what you write, it makes a server a great place to store stuff you're thinking about doing.

</div>

Ultimately, when the next day *does* come, I go back here and, if I fail to remember what I wanted to do that day, I go here and see what I wrote down to do.

Then, I do it (obviously) and then rinse and repeat this cycle.

Or, of course, you can just use a to-do app, but that's bland.

> **TL;DR:** Use whatever you want, but if you use Discord a lot, use Discord to store your to-do's aswell.
