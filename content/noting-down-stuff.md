***Shameless plug:** If you're looking for a good way to write down and manage your notes, check out [Notetxt](https://notetxt.xyz), a note-taker app with a focus on minimalism and simplicity.*

A lot of the time, but more often than not when I go to bed, I remember or think about something that I want to do the next day. People have a tendency to forget things after they sleep, so they need to note it down somewhere, but how exactly should they?

There are a host of options out there for noting stuff down, some being built specifically for that purpose, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which uses Markdown to let you write down notes.

However, I do it in a different way to most people, which is one that I haven't seen many other people doing. I note down most of my stuff on [Discord](https://discord.com):

At first, this might sound odd.

And that's a fair question. However, anyone can make a [server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034842871-How-do-I-join-a-Server#h_01FSJF2HANX9JMZC99WDFAT33T), and that server can have just **you** as the sole person in it. Since nobody else can see what you write, effectively declaring it private, it actually makes a server quite a good place to store stuff you're thinking about doing. Not to mention, [more people than me do this aswell](https://x.com/locationcarti/status/1822325212328710489):

When the next day does eventually arrive, I go back to the server I use and check what I wrote down to do. Then, I do whatever I wrote down. 

Of course, you *can* just use a to-do or a note-taker app, and that's exactly what I do now by using [Notetxt](https://www.notetxt.xyz/), but I still think this is a pretty interesting method which I don't see people talk about often.
