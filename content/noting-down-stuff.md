description: The way I note down stuff I think about doing.
---

A lot of the time, but commonly when I go to bed, I remember or think about something that I want to do the next day. We have a tendency to forget things after we sleep, so I need to note it down somewhere, but how exactly?

There are a host of options out there for how to write stuff down, some built specifically for that purpose, like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which uses Markdown files to let you write down notes.

However, I do it in an uncommon way, that I haven't seen many other people doing. **I note down stuff on [Discord](https://discord.com)**. 

At first, this might sound odd, until you realize that anyone can make a server that is just **you** in it, and since nobody else can see what you write, aka private, it makes a server a great place to store stuff you're thinking about doing.

Ultimately, when the next day does come, I go back here and check what I wrote down to do. Then, I do the thing in question, and rinse and repeat. Of course, you can just use a to-do app, and I have **tried** to, but I simply can't get used to them. I use Discord quite a bit since I have it open all hours of the day, so I feel storing my todo's there helps me store them in a place I'm familiar with.
