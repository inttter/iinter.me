A lot of the time, but more often than not when I go to bed, I remember or think about something that I want to do the next day. People have a tendency to forget things after they sleep, so they need to note it down somewhere, but how exactly should they?

There are a host of options out there for noting stuff down, some being built specifically for that purpose, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which uses Markdown to let you write down notes.

However, I did it in a different way to most people, which is one that I haven't seen many other people doing. I noted down most of my stuff on [Discord](https://discord.com):

At first, this might sound odd.

That's a fair question. However, anyone can make a [server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034842871-How-do-I-join-a-Server#h_01FSJF2HANX9JMZC99WDFAT33T) or a [group](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/223657667-Group-Chat-and-Calls), and that server/group can have only **you** as the sole person within it. Since nobody else can see what you write, it effectively declares them private, making them good methods of storing stuff that you think about. 

Not to mention, it isn't just me who does this:

When the next day does eventually arrive, I go back to the server I use and check what I wrote down to do. Then, I do whatever I wrote down. 

Of course, you *can* just use a to-do or a note-taker app, and that's exactly what I do now by using [Notetxt](https://www.notetxt.xyz/), but I still think this is a pretty interesting method which I don't see people talk about often.
