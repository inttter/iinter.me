description: How I use my tool, discid, to find people's statuses on Discord, directly from the command line.
slug: using-discid

A few weeks ago, I made a tool called [**discid**](https://discid.xyz). In a short summary, it's a command-line tool to check a user's Discord status using [Lanyard](https://github.com/phineas/lanyard).

Lanyard lets you expose your Discord presence and activities to a RESTful API. discid uses Lanyard to fetch users' statuses, and provides that information in a neat form in the command line.

To install discid, run the following in your terminal:

```
npm install -g discid
```

This will globally install the package, so you can run it from anywhere on your machine.

To find someone's user ID, run this code in the terminal, replacing <kbd>userID</kbd> with the ID of the user you want to check the status of:

```
discid <userID>
```

#  How do you find a user ID?

**(1)** Enable Developer mode by going to **Settings** ‚ûî **Advanced** ‚ûî **Developer Mode**, and check the toggle.

<div align="center">

</div>

**(2)** Right click on a user and click *Copy User ID*.

</div>

**(3)** Go back to your command line and run <kbd>discid userID</kbd>, replacing <kbd>userID</kbd> with the ID you copied. For example, if you had the user ID ***514106760299151372*** (my user ID!) copied, you would run:

```
discid 514106760299151372
```

Depending on what the user's status is, different things may come up. For example, this is what it looks like right now as of me writing this:

```
iinter ‚Ä¢ üü¢ Online
Listening To: It Ain't Hard to Tell by Nas on Illmatic ‚Ä¢ 3min 14sec left
Playing: Visual Studio Code ‚Ä¢ üìÇ website  ‚Ä¢ üìù using-discid.md (51, 4) ‚Ä¢ 44min 39sec
Platform: Desktop

```

> NOTE: In order for this to actually work, you need a user ID which is in the Lanyard Discord server: [https://discord.gg/lanyard](https://discord.gg/lanyard).

# What else?

More fields are supported. The full list that can be displayed is as follows:

* Username
* Status (eg. üü¢ Online, üü° Idle, etc...)
* Platform
* Custom Status (eg. *"üí´ This is a custom status."*)
* Playing
* Listening to Spotify
* Streaming
* Watching
* Avatar URL
* [KV](#--kv) (via the <kbd>--kv</kbd> option)

More specific details are also shown for certain fields. For example, the time left on a song, activity/state details, and more:

```
Duvet by b√¥a on Twilight ‚Ä¢ 1min 54sec left # time left on a song
Rainbow Six Siege ‚Ä¢ STANDARD match - Round 4 / 6 ‚Ä¢ 11min 52sec # activity/state details
```

# Options

There's a few command line options also available:

#### <kbd>--json</kbd>

This option will print the user's information in a JSON response. You can see an example of this with user ID **514106760299151372** below:

#### <kbd>--open</kbd>

This option will open the user's Discord profile in your browser. You can see an example of this in action below:

<div align="center">
<img src="/blog/using-discid/open-option-example.gif">
</div>

### <kbd>--kv</kbd>

Lanyard also has [key-value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%E2%80%93value_pair) (KV for short) which allow a key-value store to be added to the response.

> "When a KV pair is updated, a <kbd>PRESENCE_UPDATE</kbd> for the user will also be emitted through the Lanyard socket."

Here's an example with the KV of ***514106760299151372***:

```
{
  "kv": {
    "email": "hi@iinter.me",
    "location": "UK",
    "website": "https://iinter.me"
  },
  # rest of response...
}
```
