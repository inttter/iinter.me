I often find myself getting bored a lot. I spend quite a bit of time staring at my screen, thinking, *"What should I do?"* while I usually have something like a video or music playing in the background. This is especially true during those late nights when I stay up until the middle of the night, whether it'd be that I'm on my phone, or watching anime. I don't want to sleep, but I have nothing else to do.

## Personal Experiences

Everyone has their own ways of getting bored. For me, there are a few specific patterns I’ve noticed. Here are some examples that come to mind:

* **Overplaying a song** — This one is most obvious to me. The process usually involves me finding a new song, having a new obsession to the song, playing it **over** and **over** again, and eventually I start to drift away from the song, as I get quote on quote 'tired' of it.
* **Overplaying a game** — This involves the process of me often sticking to a game I play regularly until it becomes one of the only games I play for weeks or months.
* **Repetitive tasks / Routines** — Don't get me wrong, I **love** sticking to routines sometimes! I've been doing it for basically my entire life, but when it's doing monotonous and boring tasks or chores like having to go somewhere every day or coming home and doing a task, it can become super dull. For example, I might play for about ~1-2 hours, then do some work, then watch something, then eat, and then rinse and repeat this cycle. **I still experience this even today**, and I've been consciously trying to switch up what I do and how I do it.

There are more, but these are the ones I wanted to talk about in more detail. I find myself thinking about these three all of the time and what I can do about them.

## What I've Gotten Into

In order to tackle this, I have had to find **something to do**. In order to accomplish this, I've resorted to a few things, which I'll talk about below. Most of these also come from recent experience or events that have occurred.

### Anime

About a month and a half ago (from the time of writing this), I was recommended by a friend to watch [Your Lie in April](https://anilist.co/anime/20665/Your-lie-in-April/), a **music-focused romance anime** about a piano prodigy that is unable to play music after his mother dies. This is the case until he meets a girl who plays the violin.

</div>

I'll keep this post blunt and spoiler-free, but it is a **very** good watch. This was the show that got me hooked onto watching anime, and particularly romance anime. Before this, the only anime that I watched consisted of:

* [Demon Slayer](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/) (Season 1, 2 and 3)
* [Cyberpunk Edgerunners](https://anilist.co/anime/120377/Cyberpunk-Edgerunners/)
* [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/Serial-Experiments-Lain/) 

As of this post, though, I have watched over a dozen anime, most fitting into the romance genre, but also into other genres like drama, comedy, supernatural and psychological.

If you want to see all the shows I've watched, you can visit my anime list, see the ratings I gave to each show, which ones were my favorites and any additional notes directly on this website! [Click here](/anime) to visit it.

### Games

[Earlier](#my-own-experiences), I talked about how I get hooked onto a game and play it for an extended period of time, and then gradually start playing it less and less. This is mostly because I feel it starts becoming a "chore" for me to play. I feel like I almost have an **obligation** to play it, even when I don't want to.

However, there are times when I decide to return to a game, either because I haven't played it in a while and there are new updates, or because I saw something about the game that reignited my interest, the latter being more common.

One game this cycle happens to me with frequently is **Minecraft**. I've been playing on and off for a long time, starting with the console edition. Typically, I play the game for a few weeks, often on servers like Hypixel where I enjoy PvP. I also create survival worlds with friends, which leads to what many people refer to as the **'2 Week Minecraft Phase'**, which you can watch an explanation of [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRGSauEf8PE).

I'm not going to go into excruciating detail for every game this has occurred to me in, but some honorable mentions for me are:

* **osu!** - I've played osu! since late 2020, and currently, I am almost rank 350,000. Recently, I have been playing a lot more than I used to and have been improving, not just at osu! but at my aim and reaction time. If you go to my [profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19054376), you can see that most of my top plays were set within the last month. Read more about this [here](/writing/rusting-and-derusting).

* **Rocket League** - I have played Rocket League since it came out back in 2015. Every couple of seasons, I decide to come back to the game and grind the game out, trying to achieve a higher rank than my peak, which was Champion 3. I loved the game, but with recent decisions made by Epic Games, they have made me much less interested and inclined to play as frequently as I otherwise would.
* **Roblox** - The game that mostly got me back into Roblox was [Deepwoken](https://www.roblox.com/games/4111023553/Deepwoken). Ever since then, Roblox has been one of my permanent main games, one of the sole reasons being that it becomes very fun with friends. Although my time spent on it has died down a little bit, I still play *almost* everyday.

### Holiday: Romania

In my case at least, in order to cure my boredom, I need to find something I either used to do, or try something completely new.

Last year, I traveled to my home country, Romania, for the first time in **7 years**. I managed to visit a lot of famous and significant locations, such as my family members and landmarks. 

For just over a week during this holiday, I went on a road trip with my family and some closer extended family. During this time, we visited a variety of locations. Most notable to me, I saw the [Transfăgărășan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transf%C4%83g%C4%83r%C4%83%C8%99an) (see images 1-3 below) for the first time. I've heard my family talk about it in the past, so I was excited to see it in person for myself to see the views it had to offer.

I also traveled on the [Transalpina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transalpina_(DN67C)). Images 4-6 below are just a few of the best pictures that I managed to take of this mountain road. We originally went to this mountain by accident, when we took a wrong turn, but in the end, this turned out to be more of a good thing rather than a bad thing. There were many hotels on this hill too, so we made our own little makeshift barbecue with the help of the hotel we were staying at!

I honestly forgot the feeling of being on a holiday, since I been stuck in the United Kingdom for almost my entire life. It was a **massive** refresher to be able to see some new (and old!) scenes once again.

This holiday helped me forget about the boredom I was facing after going on summer break. Everybody I knew was on holiday, so I thought it would be a good year to finally also join that group of people and go on holiday with my own family.

I personally think that doing these kinds of things has allowed me to take some pressure off of myself.

It allows me to spend the day doing something I enjoy or something I found which piqued my interest. This leads me to be in a more positive mood and it makes me happy knowing that I am enjoying what I am doing.
