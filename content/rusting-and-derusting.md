The concept of rusting and derusting is a common phenomenon within gaming, occurring in many different methods and areas. It happens to almost anybody who has a game they continuously play. Eventually, people will get bored and tired of the game, so they **stop playing**. People can stop playing a game for multiple reasons:

* **Routines** — As I mentioned in my [other post](/writing/being-bored#my-own-experiences), playing the same game can quickly become a boring a boring and monotonous routine, especially when you are doing the same things every single day. In this case, this break will come naturally.
* **Personal Things** — Things can be going on within a person's life, positive or negative, which leads to a reduced amount of time to play.
* **Burnout** — More common with more popular influencers, the constant feeling of having to play a game to keep up can lead to burnout.
* **New Interests** — Simply put, people might be interested in other games or hobbies more than the game they were playing before, so they commit more of their time to them.

## osu!

My recent derusting and improvement within [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) is a perfect example for this post. 

In my last post, I mentioned how I have been playing a lot more than I used to, and how I have been improving, not just at osu!, but at my aim and reaction time aswell. This has, in turn, boosted my rank at the time of writing this by around **160,000** ranks. 60 days ago, I was rank **524,000**. Now, as I am writing, I am up to rank **370,000** (nearest 10,000th), which is a **40%** increase.

In the graph above, we can directly see where I got burned out, became rusty and when I derusted. 

The first burnout we can spot occurs in **September 2021**. After an August with **1,252** plays. The following month, I had only **166** plays, a sharp **86%** drop in playcount within just one month. 

This drop occurred due to the fact that I bought a brand new computer which could run any AAA game at the time with maximum settings, meaning I had a lot of games I wanted to play on my new machine. 

osu! was not one of these games, although I had installed it on my new machine along with my beatmaps, as, before, I had played it on my very slow laptop which could only run the game on around 60fps maximum. It also had minimal storage, so I could not download many beatmaps.

</div>

### Rusting

What followed in the next few months after that sharp drop in playcount was me becoming rusty. I dropped even lower to an average of only **32** plays a month. Any plays I *did* set were mediocre at best and gained almost no rank from, such as this one:

</div>

This ended up dissapointing me, as I felt my skill take a significant toll, even when I tried to [play more](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/q6kr3m/play_more/) in the following month of April 2022, which saw a jump to **854** plays. However, this quickly went back down to single-digit numbers as I became more busy with personal and online things. I had sporadic increases within my playcount from time to time, but I still could not shake off the rust I'd developed from not playing for an extensive period of time.

### Derusting

After this stagnation of playcount, I went on to other games and essentially forgot about osu! for the most part, excluding the community and updates to the game. 

Overtime, though, the same process happens in other games. You get tired of a game, and move on. Basically, I had nothing to do. No main game, nothing to watch ([though, that has changed now](/writing/being-bored#anime)), nothing.

Let's go back to that playcount graph for a moment:

<img src="/images/being-bored/osu-play-history.png" alt="Graph of the amount of plays I have had on osu! since my account creation date.">

As you can see, there is a **major** spike in the time period of April-June 2024, with the total playcount within these 3 months totalling up to ~**4100** plays. This is, evidently, where I **derusted**. 

Since I had absolutely nothing to do, and I was on spring break, I decided that osu! could be a way to kill the time. As I played more to kill the time, I gradually got better at faster, more jump-oriented maps by, simply put, playing more.

My recent rank gains and plays also show the above to be true. Take the video earlier up in this post. During my rust period, I played maps around **3✰**, which are relatively slow. 

However, my recent plays consist of **4✰**-**5.5✰** star maps. Most maps within these star ranges include harder jumps and streams. They are also great for [Double Time](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Double_Time) (DT), which I have recently been playing a lot of maps with. I also play some **3✰** maps using DT.

For example, here is one of my recent plays using DT:

This streak of improvement and new and better plays increased my motivation, in turn giving me a better mindset while playing a beatmap. I regained the the skill I originally had, and by far surpassed my original skill level.

As of now, my sharp gain in rank has mostly normalised, and I normally gain around ~**500** ranks within a single day, or more if I set a good play. Thanks to my practise, I now have the skill to get even better plays than before, regardless of the amount of rank I gain.

This process may happen again, who knows? But in the meantime, I'm looking to use what I've learnt from a proper rust and derust experience to help me in future games aswell.
