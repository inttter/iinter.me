description: An analogy of rusting and derusting, explained through my own anecdote with osu!.

***Rusting** — To lose most of your skills at a game after not having played for a while.*

***Derusting** — To regain your skills at a game after not having played for a while; to reverse the process of rusting.*

The concept of rusting and derusting is a common phenomenon within gaming which occurs in many different methods and areas. It happens to almost anybody who continuously does an activity for an extended period of time. Eventually, people will end up getting bored and tired, so they **stop** doing the activity. People can stop for multiple reasons:

* **Routines** — As I mentioned in my [other post](/writing/being-bored#my-own-experiences), doing the same thing can quickly become a boring a boring and monotonous routine which feels like a chore, especially since you are doing the same things every single day. In this case, a break will come naturally.
* **Personal Things** — Things can be going on within a person's life, either positive or negative, which leads to a reduced amount of time to allocate to the activity.
* **Burnout** — The constant feeling of having do the activity to keep up can lead to getting burnt out and exhausted.
* **New Interests** — Simply put, people might be interested in other hobbies more than the one they were doing before, so they allocate more of their time to them.

## How This Has Affected Me

I've had my fair share of rusting and derusting, mostly within video games. My recent derusting and improvement within [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) is a great example for the topic of this post. 

In my last post, I mentioned how I have been playing osu! a lot more frequently than ever before, and how I've been improving, not just at osu!, but at my aim and reaction time too. 

In turn, this has propelled my rank at the time of writing this by around **160,000** ranks. 60 days ago, I was rank **524,000**. Now, at the time of writing, I am up to rank **360,000** (to the nearest 10,000th). That is a **45%** increase!

### Burnout

In the graph above, we can directly see when I got burnt out, when I tried to come back, when I became rusty at the game, and when I derusted. 

The first burnout we can spot occurs in **September 2021**. After an August with **1,252** plays. The following month, I had only **166** plays, a sharp **86%** drop in playcount within just one month. 

This drop occurred due to the fact that I bought a brand new computer which could run any triple-A title that was out at the time with maximum settings, something which was practically unheard to me at the time. This meant that I had a lot of games sitting in my backlog which I wanted to play on my new machine. 

osu! was not one of these games, although I had installed it on my new machine along with my old beatmaps from my old computer. This is because before, I had played it on my very slow laptop which could only run the game on around **60FPS** maximum. It also had minimal storage, so I could not download many beatmaps.

</div>

### Rusting

What followed in the next few months after that sharp drop in playcount was me becoming rusty. I dropped even lower to an average of only **32** plays a month. Any plays I *did* set were mediocre at best and gained almost no rank from, such as this one:

<div align="center">

</div>

Notice the spinners? Back then, I had no proper clue how to spin (or click) fast.

This ended up disappointing me, as I felt my skill take a significant toll, even when I tried to [play more](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/q6kr3m/play_more/) in the following month of April 2022, which saw a jump to **854** plays. However, this quickly went back down to single-digit numbers as I became busy with personal and online things. 

I had sporadic increases within my playcount from time to time, but I still could not shake off the rust I'd developed from not playing for an extensive amount of time.

### Derusting

After this stagnation of playcount, I went on to other games and essentially forgot about osu! for the most part, excluding the fact that I kept up with most of the community and all the updates to the game. 

Over time, though, the same process happens in other video games. You get tired of a video game, and move on to the next. Essentially, I had nothing to do. No main game, nothing to watch ([though, that has changed now](/writing/being-bored#anime)), nothing to pass the time at all.

Let's go back to that playcount graph for a moment:

As you can see, there is a **major** spike in the time period of April-June 2024, with the total playcount within these 3 months totalling up to ~**4100** plays. This is, evidently, where I **derusted**. 

Since I had absolutely nothing to do, and I was on spring break, I decided that osu! could be a way to kill the time. As I played more to kill the time, I gradually got better at faster, more jump-oriented maps by, simply put, playing more.

My recent rank gains and plays also prove this. For example, take the video earlier up in this post. During my rust period, I played maps around **3✰**, which are relatively slow. 

However, my recent plays consist of **4✰**-**5.5✰** star maps. Most maps within these star ranges include harder jumps and streams. These maps typically award around <kbd>100pp+</kbd> when full-comboed, and can award even more **Score** and [PP](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Performance_points) when using mods like [Hidden](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hidden) (HD) or [Double Time](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Double_Time) (DT). Both mods increase the map's difficulty and readability, thus offering higher rewards for their completion.

To give you an example of this, here's a DT play which I set earlier this month:

</div>

This streak of improvement, along with better plays and skill, increased my motivation. In turn, this gave me a better mindset while playing. I regained the the skill I originally had, and by far surpassed my original skill level.

---

As of now, my sharp gain in rank has mostly normalized, and I normally gain around ~**500** ranks within a single day, or more if I set a good play. Thanks to my practice, I now have the skill to get even better plays than before, regardless of the amount of rank I gain.

This process might happen again, who knows? But in the meantime, I'm looking to use what I've learnt from a proper rust and derust experience to help me **in the future** too.
