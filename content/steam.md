description: I love Steam. I use it every day for playing my games, and it is arguably the best launcher in the PC gaming market, and is why I made this post in order to explain why I feel this way.

If you ever purchased a PC game before, it was almost 100% purchased from the Steam platform. With over 120 million users a month, it's the biggest distributor for games in the world. There's no bullshit that you need to get through to launch a game. Simply launch Steam, select the game, and **Play**. Three clicks.

I have used Steam for about four years ever since I switched over from [this old, barely functioning Xbox One](/images/forza-horizon-3/xbox-one-s.png), to a much better computer which is now my daily driver.

The whole reason I wrote this is because of one of Steam's latest features that they have announced, named [Steam Families](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4149575031735702628).

> *Hello! We are excited to announce the launch of Steam Families, now accessible in the Steam Beta Client. This feature introduces significant updates and improvements to family sharing, parental controls, and child purchase requests.*

### Sales

One of the best and most commonly known things about Steam is the amount of sales there are every single year. Over the course of a year, they have the four major sales, one for each season of the year. They also have smaller sales, which usually revolve around a certain theme, such as games from a specific country or genre. Some games are still full-price anyway, especially recently released ones. This video is a good example.

Besides that, I have found some great games from these sales, particularly the seasonal ones. One of my favorites and most memorable of these was [OneShot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/), a top down puzzle/adventure game.

### Community

The Steam Community is where a lot of things, including, but not limited to the [Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/), [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/), and other things like Reviews, Guides, Artwork, and more are located.

For example, for Counter-Strike, the market has been one of the major contributing factors to keeping the CS scene alive by giving it a real-world economy with real-world money and value, creating new content for the game. 

The workshop has let games continue off of their communities by letting them make custom mods/maps/anything to expand the game, and the rest are (mostly) QOL features which expand the experience in a good way. For example, reviews give you an idea of people's opinions of the game before you decide to buy it.

### Other Launchers

Obviously, there are more launchers in the market than just Steam, but they are very lackluster and mediocre at best, as they lack most things which Steam has.

Let's take an example like the [Epic Games Launcher](https://epicgames.com). When it comes to mind, all I know it for is to launch Fortnite. It took them [**three years**](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-games-store-shopping-cart) to add a **shopping cart**. Not to mention, the launcher itself is very lackluster and soulless, that's including all of the games on it. The only redeeming factor of the Epic launcher is that there is a free game every week that you can claim, although most aren't that good in my opinion.

Some other launchers like the EA App sometimes decide to not want to work. In my experience, whenever I play an EA game like Need For Speed, either the game will have issues (ie. controller not working) or the launcher will, for some reason, just uninstall itself. I have to manually reinstall it and repair it by redownloading it from the EA website and selecting the **'Repair'** option.

What I also don't like the fact that a lot of games on Steam, mostly from publishers like EA or Ubisoft (you might be able to see a common trend here) love to embed their own launcher into the game, so that when I click **'Play'**, it actually opens the launcher of the publisher, and launches the game from there. Simply put, there is **NO** point of this. Why should I have to launch a launcher from another launcher and wait over a minute for the game to open?

To prove this point, here is a comparison between two games. The vide on the left is a typical launch of [Rainbow Six Siege](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359550/Tom_Clancys_Rainbow_Six_Siege/) (a Ubisoft game) through Steam, while the video on the right is a typical launch of [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/), which is a game that does not have another launcher packaged with it.

### UI

The UI is clean, plain and simple. There are four sections.

* **Store**, containing games for purchase
* **Library**, containing your library of games
* **Community**, which is where community-created things are categorized into
* **Username**, which contains profile-related options

There is no lag, issues, or anything, which is unlike Rockstar. For some reason, it eats my computer's resources up. The UI did recently [get a redesign](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3686801719529689368) as well, which also made it look nicer.

| Old | New |

Although, some parts of the UI have taken quite a while to update, or have not been updated in years. An example of this is the Server Browser, commonly used in games with community maps and/or servers, such as [CS2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/) and [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). The Server Browser was only updated 11 months ago, prior to which had been many years without change.

### Valve

Valve is the company behind Steam. They have made some very iconic games. For example, [Half-Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/), [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/) + [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/), [Counter-Strike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/), and more. They formed Steam in 2003 to serve as a distribution channel for games. They have also created hardware like the recently released [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) and the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex).

### End

Steam is great and has a lot of features which help to extend it and provide QOL features, where as most other launchers lack these features as they are either **barebones**, lack anything **notable** about them, or are just downright **bad** or **hard** to use. Sometimes, it can be all three.
