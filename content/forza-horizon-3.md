description: A little blog post about my experience growing up playing Forza Horizon 3, a game released in 2016 by Playground Games.

In Christmas of 2016, I recieved an Xbox One S. It was the first time I was able to properly play games after being stuck on a PS3 for a long time. I got a few games along with it too, such as:

* Rocket League
* Minecraft (the *OLD* one.)
* FIFA 17 (although I was never really into football)

And of course, **Forza**, specifically, [Horizon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3) 
(which is sadly delisted now).

This is the main talking point of this blog post. This is mostly a nostalgia trip for me, so don't mind any odd things.

# The First Experience

In my opinion, Forza Horizon 3 was the ***best*** Forza Horizon game out of the 5 that have released. Everything about the game was at its peak at the time. The community, the new features, the **cars** themselves, and more. 

The first game I installed on that Xbox above was Forza Horizon 3. I also remember booting it up for the first time to hear the **amazing** title screen music. For those curious, you can see it below:

# Progressing Through

Most of my time on this game was spent [Freeroaming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_roam) around the map, trying to get every collectable, driving over every little road that was still marked gray, and more.

Thanks to me not having [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/gold) for a total of 2 years, I didn't have the chance play online for the duration of the game's maintainablility. I did come back way later into the future, but I basically spent all of my time on this game playing singleplayer.

Aside from only freeroaming, I also roleplayed (**don't question it.**), in the form of roleplaying doing different things inside of FH3, like delivering things, and also general freeroaming.

> **Fun Fact:** I only started doing this because of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDQ7KLGe42s) I saw back in ~2017.</span>

I also progressed through the game normally, by buying new cars, upgrading them, driving them, completing [FORZATHON](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3/Forzathon) events, and taking photo's of my cars, which I'd love to show the ones I made back then here, but they [removed the functionality to save them](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1551360/discussions/0/3416557114763087581/). Instead, here's some photo's from FH4 and FH5:

# Community

The Forza community at this time was at its peak.

When I wasn't playing the game, most of the time I would be watching somebody like [AR12Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AR12Gaming) talk about the newest update or playing a minigame, or watching a ompilation from somebody like [Shinyodd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE37PeTZtEg&t=37s) or [YEAHMAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AoTnOHIJE).

# The Present

It's been 8 years since I first touched this game, and I sometimes take out my dust-filled Xbox (that, at this point, I don't know how long it's been since I've touched it), put the disc inside of the console, and launch the game to drive around for a little bit.

Another positive is that I no longer have problems playing online anymore, so I've also went online in most of my latest sessions, and played minigames like Infection or King, along with freeroaming and racing. You can **still** find full lobbies on this game, even after 8 years.

When I first tried to go back to this game, I wanted to do it on PC, because I have [all of my games there](https://steamcommunity.com/id/intermed/), and FH3 has [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), meaning that if you played a game on your Xbox, you could go on the same account on PC and be able to play the game there too.

I did try to do this, but unfortunately, even though I was on the right account, I couldn't:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/blog/forza-horizon-3/fh3-delisted.png" alt="Clicking 'Choose Option' would tell me every version was unavailable">
</div>

 I could not download, or even buy the game, because they [delisted it in 2020](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-Forza-Horizon-3-Unavailable-for-Purchase#:~:text=Forza%20Horizon%203%20and%20its,game%20and%20its%20associated%20content.). I went through different rabbit holes to try and get access to the game without paying hundreds of $$$ for a PC key, but I stopped because I wasn't willing to dig deeper and get myself into something shady.

I ended up just giving up and opened my Xbox for the first time in months, to redownload the game ([shockingly, only 46GB](https://www.google.com/search?q=fh3+install+size+xbox&source=lmns&bih=752&biw=772&client=opera-gx&hs=lfP&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvou2u2-eEAxXPbKQEHUb1CkcQ0pQJKAB6BAgBEAI)). This is the reason I hate the delisting of games.

# Conclusion

This game gave me **so** much nostalgia, and it is, ultimately, one of my top 3 games of all time. Feel free to disagree, but that's just my opinion. If you ever get a chance to play this game, you should.

While the game is delisted, it had a big impact on my personality by sparking an interest in me for racing games and cars that I still have to this day.

> "What about the newer games?"

Try [Forza Horizon 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/), but probably not [Forza Horizon 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/).

</div>

170 GB just for a Forza installment, which its new content is recycled cars from previous titles, is insane. That's a fifth of my PC. When the game came out, it was only ~80 GB, which is the same as Horizon 4, 6 years after launch.

In summary, this is my favourite game.
