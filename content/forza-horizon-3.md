description: A game released in 2016 by Playground Games. Here is my personal experience with it!
---

In Christmas of 2016, I recieved an Xbox One S. It was the first time I was able to properly play games after being stuck on a PS3 for a long time. My PS3 was the console I was stuck on for quite a few years, even after the (now) last-gen consoles each came out in 2014. I got a few games along with my Xbox aswell. For example, some prominent ones I got were [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.com) and [Minecraft Xbox One Edition](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Xbox_One_Edition). As a part of these games, I got [Forza Horizon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3) as well, a prominent racing game from the Forza franchise back in 2016, which was the same year in which the game released.

This post goes into more detail about my personal experience with the game, and my opinions on it.

## First Time

When I first played, it was generally argued that Forza Horizon 3 was the best Horizon game out of the, at that point, 3-game franchise. Everything about the game was at its highest point at the time, from the community, developer interaction, the **cars** being added to the game, and more.

I got curious a few months back, and searched for the first game which I installed by checking my first achievements, which, coincidentally, one of them was Forza Horizon 3. I also remember opening the game up for the first time to hear the (now nostalgic) title screen music. For those curious, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbJUm_AfJs).

## Progressing Through

I spent most time on this game [freeroaming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_roam) around the map, trying to get every collectable ([there's a lot](https://www.ign.com/maps/forza-horizon-3/australia)), driving over every road that was still marked gray, (meaning they were unfound and [there was also 488 of them](https://www.trueachievements.com/a223064/i-know-these-roads-achievement)) and more.

Thanks to me not having [Xbox Live Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/gold) for a total of 2 years, I didn't have the chance play online for the duration of the game's maintainablility by the developers, which lasted until 2020. I did come back a few years later, after which I got the chance to play multiplayer, but I mostly spent my time on this game playing singleplayer.

I also progressed through the game normally, by buying new cars with the Credits I accumalated, carefully upgrading and tuning them, driving them around the map, freeroaming with them, completing [FORZATHON](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_3/Forzathon) events, and taking photos of these cars which I built myself. I'd love to show the screenshots that I took back then here, but they [removed the functionality to save them](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1551360/discussions/0/3416557114763087581/) along with the game's delisting. Instead, here's some photo's from Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5.

## Community

In simple terms, the Forza community at this time reached its highest point.

When I wasn't playing the game, most of the time I would be watching somebody like [AR12Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AR12Gaming) talk about the newest update or playing a minigame, or watching a compilation from somebody like [Shinyodd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE37PeTZtEg&t=37s) or [YEAHMAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AoTnOHIJE).

## The Present

It's been over 8 years since I first played this game, and sometimes, I take out my Xbox which is covered in dust, put the disc inside of the console, and launch the game to drive around for a bit.

A positive of this is that I no longer have problems playing online anymore, so I've also went online in most of my latest sessions, and played minigames like [Infection and King](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005307274-FH3-Playground-Games), along with freeroaming and, most of the time, racing. You can **still** find full lobbies on this game, even after the game got discontinued.

When I first tried to go back to this game, I wanted to do it on PC, because I have all of my games there, and Forza Horizon 3 has [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), meaning that if you played a game on your Xbox, as long as you used the same account on your computer, you could go it and be able to play the game there too without having to pay anything, and also be able to keep your save progress.

I did try to do this, but unfortunately, since the game was delisted, and even though I was using the same account from my Xbox on the Microsoft Store, the game was unavailable for download.

<img src="/images/forza-horizon-3/fh3-delisted.png" alt="Clicking 'Choose Option' would tell me every version was unavailable.">

I could not download, or even buy the game, because they [delisted it in 2020](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-Forza-Horizon-3-Unavailable-for-Purchase#:~:text=Forza%20Horizon%203%20and%20its,game%20and%20its%20associated%20content.). I went through different rabbit holes to try and get access to the game without paying hundreds of $$$ for a key of the PC version of the game, but I stopped because I wasn't willing to dig deeper and get myself into something shady.

I ended up just dropping the search and opened my Xbox for the first time in months to redownload the game (which, shockingly, was [only 46GB](https://www.google.com/search?q=fh3+install+size+xbox&source=lmns&bih=752&biw=772&client=opera-gx&hs=lfP&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvou2u2-eEAxXPbKQEHUb1CkcQ0pQJKAB6BAgBEAI)). This is a good example of the disadvantages of delisting these old games. Obviously, there are valid reasons, such as licensing, but it does suck.

## Conclusion

This game gave me **so** much nostalgia, and it is ultimately in my list of the top 5 games that I have ever played.

While the game is now delisted, it sparked an interest for racing and cars in general that I still have to this day.

> *"What about the newer games?"*

Try [Forza Horizon 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/), but probably not [Forza Horizon 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/).

170 GB just for a Forza installment, which the new content of is recycled cars from previous titles and then advertised as **"new!"** content, is insane. That's 1/5 of my computer. When the game came out, it was only about 80GB, which is the same as Horizon 4, **6** years after launch.
